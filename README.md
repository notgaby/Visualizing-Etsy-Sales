# Visualizing-Etsy-Sales
**This project was created during my independent study class as a senior in high school. **

Visualization of data using Matplotlib. My main goals for this project was to 1) learn how to open data from a csv file and 2) manipulate the data in various ways. Looking back now, the code for this was inefficient, though it introduced me to data visualization and Matplotlib.
